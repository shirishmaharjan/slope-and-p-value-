Notation of slope and p value 

While working in the table you need to use this notation 

Single * in the slope for p value less tha equal to 0.05 and up to 0.01
Double ** in the slope for the p value less than 0.01 

In this way you dont need to mention the p value in the table you and can keeo a common notation at the end of the table which will work for all the slope and table.
